# ATTRITION
Supporting material for our [RL-based Trojan insertion work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560690) published at CCS 2022.

The original (i.e., Trojan-free) files are in the "original_files" directory. The HT-infested designs are uploaded in a tar format (except for AES) in the "HT_infested_designs" directory. You can use them to evaluate the quality of any given set of test patterns. The other files/directories are auxilliary and are not required to evaluate your test patterns.


# CITATION
If you use our tool and/or Trojans in your research, please cite our paper.
